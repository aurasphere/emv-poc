# emv-poc
Mobile app that allows to read NFC EMV card through your phone without external hardware.

This project purpose is only to demonstrate how such an app would work, so the protocol only reaches the app selection step. For the same reason, the code is a bit messy.

Don't hesitate to contact me if you want more informations/help with this project.
